# Finding Donors :moneybag:
## Description :memo:
This project is a machine learning project _classification problem_ aims to find the donors who donate with more than 50K. The charity is called **MLCharity** and it uses the demographic data about the donors.
## Approach
There are three models used to train the data. They are: 
* Decision Trees.
* Gradient Boosting (Ensemble Methods).
* Support Vector Machine (SVM).

By Comparing the three models, **Gradient Boosting** classifier was the best model according to the test F1-score and accuracy.
## Getting Started :rocket:
### Prerequisites
1. Download and Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install).
3. Install the following libraries: [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/), [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/), [sci-kit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html).
Or you can download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and install the needed libraries directly.
